Code for my Bachelor Thesis

In this repository you can find all the code I developed in order to get the results for my Bachelor Thesis.
The code is split in the following way:
- FSTGenerator folder: Here is the code to generate randomized Finite State Machines (or Finite State Transductors).
- PSqCalc folder: Here is the code for the final experiment.
- PSqCalc2 folder: Here is the code for the first experiment.
- PSqComp folder: Here is the code for the simulation.
